Using the Gatsby CLI
The Gatsby CLI tool lets you quickly create new Gatsby-powered sites and run commands for developing Gatsby sites. It is a published npm package.
The Gatsby CLI is available via npm and should be installed globally by running npm install -g gatsby-cli.
To see the commands available, run gatsby --help.

gatsby develop
This command starts a development server. You will be able to see and interact with your new site in a development environment â€” local (on your computer, not published to the internet).
