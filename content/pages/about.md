Hello!  A few years ago I became interested in learning how to code, because I thought it would be a useful tool for executing creative ideas. Unfortunately, when I thought about beginning this new endeavour I felt overwhelmed, anxious, and unqualified.  

Despite my reservations, I decided to give it a try anyways.  It has been difficult and frustrating at times. But I've also found it to be a worthwhile pursuit that is fascinating, rewarding, and even a little addicting.  I'm excited to share the ups and downs of my journey and look forward to connecting with others in the coding community!
